# Make sure the complete file will run at one go and not a question at a time
# (use different variables)
# After you are finished with your program, at the end, remove all unnecessary print statements.

# Question 1: (10 points)
# The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width.
# Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles.
# The program should tell the user which rectangle has the greater area,
# or if the areas are the same.

# Question 2: (10 points)
# Write a program that asks the user for a number.  Check to see if the number is positive, negative or zero.
# Display the appropriate message: e.g. 'Positive number', 'Negative number', 'Zero'.  Use Elif statements

# Question 3: (10 points)
# Modify the previous question so that until the user enters a positive number, it keeps asking the user for a number
# and displaying the appropriate message(s).

## Part 2: DATA SCIENCE (30 points)

# Read the file MIS3545_students.csv found in the blackboard quiz. (1 point)

# 1 Display the first five rows (3 points)
import os
print(os.getcwd())
df = pd.read_csv('MIS3545_Students.csv')

# 2 How many students are in this class? (3 points)

# 3 Summarize the student grade sheet (the complete data) (3 points)

# 4 Select the rows where Test_1 score is greater than 80 and gender is female ('F') (7 points)
df_t1hi = df[df['Test_1'] > 80]

# 5 Calculate the mean of Test_1, Test_2, Test_3 (3 points)
print('Test 1: ', str(df['Test_1'].mean()))
print('Test 2: ', str(df['Test_2'].mean()))
print('Test 3: ', str(df['Test_3'].mean()))
# 6 Students who did not complete an assignment, test or quiz should get a zero.
# Replace all the missing values with zero and display the new summary (3 points)
df.fillna(0, inplace = True)

# 7 Display a barplot where x is the 'Type', y is the 'Test_1' score and it is split by Gender (5 points) (7 points)
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
ax = sns.barplot(x='Type',y ='Test_1', hue='Gender', data=df, estimator=len)
plt.show()
# BONUS (5 points)
# Each test, assignment and quiz are equally weighted.
# Therefore, the final grade is the average of all the scores for each student.
# Who got the highest grade? [hint: create a new column for average of each row, sort it descending and print out the
# first row]

## Part 3: Twitter (30 points)

# A professor at Babson wondered how everyone thought of the different teams from Massachusetts and which team has the
# highest positive polarity average.  Therefore modify the Twitter the following way:

    polb += analysis.sentiment[0]
    countb += 1

print('Bruins: ', str(resb))
# Compare the three averages and print out which team has the highest average polarity (10 points)
avgs = [resrs, resc, resb]
print("highest is: ", str(max(avgs)))
#Bonus (3 points)
#Ask the user to enter three team/topic and tell the user which team/topic has the highest average polarity

## Part 4: Create your own question (10 points)
# Write your own python question and its answer from any one of the above categories.
# Extra points will be given for creativity or a modification in Twitter.
